      <li>Use the arrow keys to move.</li>

        <button class="frisbee-button"
                onclick="SendMessage('player', 'ToggleFrisbees');">
          Press here to turn on (or off) the ability to throw frisbees
          by clicking the left mouse button.

    When you first open this up, you will see an example building designed
    by one of our engineers for a school project. To share your own geometry,
    log in, open up the + menu, select a project, and click on your data keys
    to select them.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can then share your keys with the share button. It provides
    links to the desktop viewer (which you're currently using) and the VR
    viewer, which is meant to be used with a VR device such as Google
    Cardboard.

    Unity puts some limitations on the size of a mesh. For example, a single
    mesh cannot have more than 65000 vertices. If you find that your meshes are
    not loading, try splitting them up into multiple data keys and loading
    each individually.
